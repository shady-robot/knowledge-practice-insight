# Introduction

In 1983, the American National Standard Institution(ANSI) established a
committee whose goal was to produce "an unambiguous and machine-independent
definition of the language C" while still retaining its spirit. The result is
the ANSI standard for C.

C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on
the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie.

C provides a variety of data types. The fundamental types are characters, and
integers and floating-point numbers of several sizes. In addition, there is a
hierarchy of derived data types created with pointer, arrays, structures and
unions.

C provides the fundamental control-flow constructions required for
well-structured programs: statement grouping, decision making, selecting one of
a set of possible cases, looping with the termination test at the top, or at
the bottom, and early loop exit.
