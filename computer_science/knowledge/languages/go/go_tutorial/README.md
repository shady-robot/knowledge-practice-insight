## Go Range

The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.
When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.

## Go methods

Go does not have classes. You can define methods on types.
A method is a function with a special receiver argument.

You can declare a method on a non-struct types. You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method. You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package.
