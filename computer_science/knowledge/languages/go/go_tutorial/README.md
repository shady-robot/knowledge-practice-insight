# Go basic

## Go Range

The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.
When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.

## Go methods

Go does not have classes. You can define methods on types.
A method is a function with a special receiver argument.
