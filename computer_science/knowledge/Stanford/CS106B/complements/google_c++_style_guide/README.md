# Google C+ Style Guide

Refers to [Resources: Google C+ Style Guide][1]

## Background

C++ has many powerful features, but this power brings with
it complexity, which in return can make code more bug-prone
and harder to read and maintain. The goal of this guide is
to manage this complexity by describing in detail the dos
and don't of writing C++ code.

## Goals of the style guide

* Style rules should pull their weight

  The benefit of a style rule must be large enough to
  justify asking all of our engineers to remember it.
* Optimize for the reader, not the writer

  More time will be spent reading most of our code
  than writing it.
* Be consistent with existing code
