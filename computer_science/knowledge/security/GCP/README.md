## VPC flow logs

VPC flow logs record network flows sent from or received by VM instances. These logs can be used for network monitoring, forensics,
real-time security analysis, and even for expense optimization.

## Web Security Scanner

Web Security Scanner identifies security vulnerabilities in your App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Compute Engine Web applications.

This service crawls your application, following all links with the scope of your starting URLs, and attempts to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers as possible. It can automatically scan and detect four common vulnerabilities, including cross-site-scripting(XSS), flash injection, mixed content(HTTP in HTTPS), and outdated/insecure libraries.

## Identity-Aware Proxy(IAP)

You would secure Compute Engine workloads using BeyondCorp Enterprise's Identity-Aware Proxy(IAP) to restrict traffic based on identity.

IAP is a feature of BeyondCorp Enterprise, Google Cloud's zero-trust solution that enables an organization's workforce to access web applications securely from anywhere, without the need for VPC and without fear of malware, phishing, and data loss.

## Google Cloud Armor

Google Cloud Armor IP blocklist/allowlist enable you to restrict or allow access to your HTTP(S) load balancer at the edge of the Google Cloud, as close as possible to the user and to malicious traffic. This prevents malicious users or traffic from consuming resources or entering your virtual
private cloud networks.
