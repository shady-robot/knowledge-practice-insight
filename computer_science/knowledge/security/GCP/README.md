## Web Security Scanner

Web Security Scanner identifies security vulnerabilities in your App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Compute Engine Web applications.

This service crawls your application, following all links with the scope of your starting URLs, and attempts to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers as possible. It can automatically scan and detect four common vulnerabilities, including cross-site-scripting(XSS), flash injection, mixed content(HTTP in HTTPS), and outdated/insecure libraries.
