# Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub is an asynchronous and scalable messaging service that decouples services producing message from services processing those message.

Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to load and distribute data. Pub/Sub lets you create systems of event producers and consumers, called `publishers` and `subscribers`. Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls(RPCs).
