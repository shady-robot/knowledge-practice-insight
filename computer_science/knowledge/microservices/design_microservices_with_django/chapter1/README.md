# What are services

In the contexts of software architecture, service-orientation and service
oriented architecture, the term service refers to a software functionality
or a set of software functionalities with a purpose that different clients
can reuse for different purposes, together with the polices that should
control its usage.

A mechanism to enable access to one or more capabilities, where the access is
provided using a prescribed interface and is exercised consistent with
constraints and policies as specified by the service description.

## Software as a service

Describe a licensing model, where you can pay for the usage of some sore of
online service. Most of these software live in the cloud and provide various
ways for the end user to modify and query data in their systems.

## Service-oriented architecture

SOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other
components by application components, through a communication protocol over
a network. Its principle are independent of vendors and other technologies.

* Business value
* Strategic goals
* Intrinsic inter-operability
* Shared services
* Flexibility
* Evolutionary refinement

## Monolithic services

Monolith means composed all in one piece. The Monolithic application describes
a single-tiered software application in which different components combined
into a single program from a single platform.

## Microservices

Microservices are an approach to application development in which a large
application is built ad a suite of modular services. Each module supports a
specific business goal and use a simple, well-defined interface to communicate
with other sets of services.

In most case, implementing a working microservice architecture takes years of
engineering working which involves not just coding, but architectural plans,
vase amounts of tooling, research of current systems, release plans, meetings,
and last but not lease, patience.
