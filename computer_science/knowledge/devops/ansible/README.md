## Ansible 
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. 


Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them. There programs are written to be resources models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules(over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.
