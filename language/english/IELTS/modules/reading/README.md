 A, B, C or D, or the best two answers from five alternatives
 (A, B, C, D or E), or the best three answers from seven alternatives
 (A, B, C, D, E, F or G). They write the letter of the answer they have chosen

statements agree with the information in the text?’ They then write ‘true’,
‘false’ or ‘not given’ in the boxes on their answer sheets. The questions are
in the same order as the information in the text: that is, the answer to the
first question in this group will be located in the text before the answer to
the second question and so on.

#### clarification

* **False**: the passage states the opposite of the statement in question
* **Not Given**: the statement is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the
  information in the passage.

  play a part when deciding on their answers.

 They will not necessarily need to find information in every paragraph/section
 of the text, but there may be more than one piece of relevant information in
 a given paragraph/section.

 Test takers are given a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case
 Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.), referring to the **main idea of the paragraph
